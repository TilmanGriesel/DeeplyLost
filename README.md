# DeeplyLost
A Proof Of Concept Stranded Deep Save Game Teleporter for Windows.

If you lost the island where you came from and you have no clue what to do to find it again, this little piece of software will help you.

### How To
First of all, this should not be a cheat tool. So I decided that it is necessary to place a camp fire somewhere on the island you want to teleport. This camp fire is used as a reference for the re-spawn. Keep in mind that you cant travel to a island without a campfire. 

* 1 - Extract the lates release zip
* 2 - Start ```DeeplyLost.exe```
* 3 - Navigate to your Stranded Deep save game called ```Save.json```*
* 4 - Drag the ```Save.json``` into the DeeplyLost window
* 5 - Select the island you wan't to go
* 6 - Press the ```Teleport``` button
* 7 - Start the game and press ```Load Game```

*Steam location: ```SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stranded Deep\Stranded_Deep_x64_Data\Data```

## Misc
If you like to give your islands names you can double click their name inside the ```DeeplyLost.exe``` and give them a name you like. The associative name will be saved in your registry at "HKEY_USERS\S-1-x-x-x\Software\DeeplyLost"

I wish you good luck and a long life
